# Iris Flower Classifier

A classifier for the Iris flower species. I manually implemented the K-Nearest Neighbours classification algorithm for learning purposes. I used 
K-fold cross validation to determine the most optimal K value which maximizes classifier accuracy through experimental trial and error.

I used Scikit-learn for K-fold cross validation, accuracy scoring, and to import the Iris dataset. I used SciPy to measure Euclidean distance between data points.

In the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm, I used a max heap of size K to store the K closest data points efficiently.
